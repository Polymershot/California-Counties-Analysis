# Analyzing California counties using the Smart Location Database (EPA)
The main objective of this college project was to pick a large dataset suitable for unsupervised learning. The main dataset is called the "Smart Location Database" from the Environmental Protection Agency. It consists of variables like jobs per industry, traffics stats, and other environmental factors on the county/census block groups level. My main objective was to do clustering on this data to see if there were any insights when it comes to classifying California regions (Southern, Northern, Central, Bay Area) in terms of their Census Block Groups. You can think of Census Block Groups as smaller "ZIP" code areas. For more information, please view the report file in the "Report" folder.
